# VR_ROBOT_CONTROL

This repository contains code and examples for using a Meta Quest Headset to control a robot in task space. It reads hand poses from the open-source library [oculus_reader](https://github.com/rail-berkeley/oculus_reader), converts them to joint positions using inverse kinematics (IK), and simulates the results in MuJoCo.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies and set up the environment, run:

```bash
./setup.bash
pip install .
pip install robot_task_space_control .
```

---

## Example Usage

To control the Unitree H1 robot using the VR headset, run the following command:

```bash
python vr_robot_control/robot_context.py
```

This command starts the control loop, enabling task-space control of the H1 robot using hand poses captured by the VR headset.
